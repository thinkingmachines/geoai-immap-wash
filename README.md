# Geospatial Modeling of Access to Water and Sanitation

This repository accompanies our research work for Geospatial Modeling of WASH Access in Colombia.

The goal of this project is to provide a means for faster, cheaper, and more scalable survey of survey of the state of WASH access using satellite images and machine learning.

## Code Organization
This repository is divided into three main parts:

- **notebooks/**: contains all Jupyter notebooks for data processing and model experimentation
- **scripts/**: contains scripts that are part of the main workflow in **notebooks/**
- **utils/**: contains utility scripts for geospatial data pre-processing and modeling
